# Introduction

The idea of base files is to 1. automate the common tasks 2. force best practice, we will go through each one of these base files in detail, but before, we **highly recommend** you to create your own base files that extend the package base files (even if not currently needed), that will allow you to customize and override as needed.

you can set the base file for each generated file in the repository config.
